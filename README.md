I am interested in creating a personal assistant using LLMs, and this repository serves as documentation of the progress and learning in the development of the project.

Here are some of the references where I learn it from :
  - [Build an AI Voice Assistant App using Multimodal LLM "Llava" and Whisper](https://youtu.be/77dJJBFPLpY?si=87yIAWTWr0-zJ_f0)
  - [Using ChatGPT with YOUR OWN Data. This is magical. (LangChain OpenAI API)](https://youtu.be/9AXP7tCI9PI?si=-0EY5o7edNYqknPm)
  - [Local Low Latency Speech to Speech - Mistral 7B + OpenVoice / Whisper | Open Source AI](https://youtu.be/0k8wUfU7n4Q?si=Yk7hHUr8IUandBj1)
